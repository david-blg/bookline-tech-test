# Candidate Brief

## Role Overview
As part of our hiring process, we want to evaluate your skills in designing and
developing a clean, functional, and well-structured application. This task will
simulate a real-world scenario and allow us to assess your ability to deliver
solutions that align with best practices and demonstrate your technical
proficiency.

## Task Description
You are tasked with creating a REST API for a car rental service. The API should
fulfill the following requirements:

### Endpoints:
- List Available Cars
- Provide an endpoint that lists all available cars for a
specific date.
- Create a Booking
- Provide an endpoint to create a booking for a car on
a given date.

### Data:
You may define the necessary data for the application yourself. The
data does not need to be overly complex, and you may omit any
unnecessary details such as images.
For the moment, use a file-based storage mechanism (e.g., JSON file)
for simplicity. There's no need to set up a database, we might get to
that later on.


## Technical Requirements

- Use any framework or tools of your choice (Python based), though we
primarily work with FastAPI and encourage its use if you are familiar
with it.
- Include basic logging to capture key application events such as:
- Successful and failed booking attempts.
- Queries for available cars.
- Include basic unit tests or integration tests for at least one endpoint.
- Ensure your solution is simple yet adheres to best practices, including
clear structure, clean code, and appropriate use of architectural
patterns.
- Containerization of your application using Docker is optional but highly
appreciated.


## Deliverables:
- A fully functional REST API with the specified endpoints.
- A public repository (e.g., GitHub) containing:
- The complete codebase.
- A clear commit history that reflects your working process.
- Include logging outputs in the application runtime.

### Documentation:
- Include a brief explanation (in the README file) of your design choices
and reasoning. The explanation does not need to be exhaustive but
should be clear and concise.
- Test cases with instructions on how to run them.


### Guidelines
Keep the task scoped to approximately 2î‚ˆ3 hours of work.
While simplicity is encouraged, ensure the solution is robust and
demonstrates your skillset effectively.
Use good coding practices, such as clean code, modular design, and clear
commit messages.
Avoid overcomplicating the solution where a straightforward approach
suffices.

### Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following aspects:
- Functionality:
Do the provided endpoints meet the requirements?
- Code Quality:
Is the code clean, well-structured, and follows best practices?
- Documentation:
Is the documentation clear and concise?
- Testing:
Are the tests comprehensive and easy to run?


- Code Quality:
Is the code clean, maintainable, and readable?
Are industry best practices followed?
- Testing:
Are basic tests included and functional?
- Logging:
Are key application events logged effectively?
Do logs provide meaningful information for debugging and monitoring?
- Design:
Does the solution demonstrate good architectural principles?
Is the project structure logical and modular?
- Documentation:
Does the README file clearly explain your design choices?
Is it easy to understand how to run and test the application?
- Optional Enhancements:
Dockerization of the application.
Additional thoughtful features or optimizations.
